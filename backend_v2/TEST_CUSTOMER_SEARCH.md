## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: 404 Not Found
**Possible Causes:**
1. Server not running
2. Route not registered
3. Wrong URL or base path

**Solution:**
- Check server is running: `http://localhost:3001/api/v2/health`
- Verify route in logs when server starts
- Check `src/routes/index.js` has `router.use("/customers", customerRoutes);`

### Issue 2: 401 Unauthorized
**Cause:** Missing or invalid token

**Solution:**
- Login again to get fresh token
- Make sure `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN` header is included
- Check token hasn't expired

### Issue 3: Empty Results
**Cause:** Customer doesn't exist or database not seeded

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run database setup/seed
npm run db:setup
```

## üìä Check Database Directly

### Connect to PostgreSQL
```bash
psql -U postgres -d pos_enterprise_db
```

### Query Customers
```sql
-- List all customers
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Search by code
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE code = 'CUST-001' AND deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Count customers
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

## üîç Debug Logs

When you call the search endpoint, you should see logs like:
```
üîç Search customers called with query: "CUST-001"
üîç Trying exact match for: "CUST-001"
‚úÖ Customer exact match found: CUST-001 - 1 results
```

If you don't see these logs, the endpoint is not being called.

## üì± Frontend Testing (Flutter)

Make sure:
1. Server is running on `http://localhost:3001`
2. App is connected (check Online/Offline indicator)
3. Token is valid (user is logged in)

Check Flutter console for detailed error messages.
